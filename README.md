# hacknet
Dismantling what goes on inside of hackclub's scrapbook system, and then building a new way of experiencing user posts!
## How to run

 1. Clone the repository  with <br>`git clone https://github.com/NimitVijayvargee/hacknet.git`
 2. Make sure you have Node installed (if you don't, you can get it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)).
 3. Boot up the server using  `node server.js` within the folder.
 4. Open your browser, and visit `localhost:6942` (haha funny number).

## Future plans

 - ~~blackmail hq to update scrapbook api~~
 - More themes (you can never have enough)
 - Prettier userpages with ✨customization✨
 - Project library where people can store their projects for the world to see
